- The idea is to not download postgresql or pgAdmin but use Docker containers to run them.
- Since we want the pgAdmin and pgDatabse to communicate with each other, they will be running inside a single container.
- Ingest the sakila data to the pgDatabse using a python script
- Then perform the SQL stuff.

1. Make a 



What is pgSQL,pgDatabse and pgAdmin?

Good question! Let’s go through the definitions clearly:

---

### 🐘 **PostgreSQL**  
➡️ **PostgreSQL** (or **Postgres**) is an **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)**.  
It allows you to store and manage structured data using **SQL** (Structured Query Language).  

**Key Features:**  
✅ Handles complex queries and large datasets efficiently  
✅ Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions → Ensures data integrity  
✅ Supports advanced features like:  
   - Window functions  
   - JSON data  
   - Full-text search  
   - Recursive queries  
✅ Extensible → You can create custom functions in Python, C, etc.  

🔎 **Think of PostgreSQL** as the **engine** that stores and processes data.  

---

### 🗄️ **pgDatabase**  
➡️ A **pgDatabase** is a specific database instance created within a PostgreSQL server.  
When you install PostgreSQL, you can create multiple **databases** inside the server — each one can have its own tables, views, and indexes.  

**Example:**  
- You install PostgreSQL → This creates a PostgreSQL server  
- You create a database called `sakila_db` → This is a `pgDatabase`  
- Inside `sakila_db`, you create tables like `customers`, `orders`, `refunds` → All stored within the pgDatabase  

🔎 **Think of pgDatabase** as a specific "project folder" inside the PostgreSQL engine.

---

### 🌐 **pgAdmin**  
➡️ **pgAdmin** is a **graphical user interface (GUI)** tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.  
It lets you interact with PostgreSQL visually instead of using the command line.  

**What you can do with pgAdmin:**  
✅ Create, modify, and delete databases and tables  
✅ Write and run SQL queries directly  
✅ Manage user roles and permissions  
✅ Monitor server health and performance  

🔎 **Think of pgAdmin** as a **control panel** for your PostgreSQL database.

### 🏆 **How They Work Together:**
1. **PostgreSQL** → The core engine handling storage and computation  
2. **pgDatabase** → A structured container within PostgreSQL to store and organize data  
3. **pgAdmin** → A convenient tool to visually explore and manage PostgreSQL databases  

---

### ✅ **Example:**  
1. You create a `sakila_db` in PostgreSQL → pgDatabase  
2. You load movie rental data into the database  
3. You use `pgAdmin` to:  
   - Write SQL queries to analyze rental trends  
   - Create a view for top 10 most rented movies  
   - Export the result for further Python analysis

👉 PostgreSQL = **Brain** 🧠  
👉 pgDatabase = **Storage** 🏢  
👉 pgAdmin = **User Interface** 💻

This combo is the foundation of most industry-level data pipelines! 🚀
